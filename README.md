# Motivation
I got into Beat Saber but haven't found a good way to automatically find beatmaps for songs I know. There are some similar projects, but they are either paid or I haven't had a good experience with them. 

# Usage
⚠️ This tool is currently alpha quality software and is not ready for production use.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required fields.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

The tool currently only searches for a playlist with the name `test` and may fail if there are too many songs in the playlist.

# Attributions

I got the name from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beatsaber/comments/hneox9/comment/fxbynuq) from [@PapuaNewGuinean](https://www.reddit.com/user/PapuaNewGuinean). I hope that's okay
