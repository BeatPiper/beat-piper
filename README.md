# Motivation
I got into Beat Saber but haven't found a good way to automatically find beatmaps for songs I know. There are some similar projects, but they are either paid or I haven't had a good experience with them. 

# Usage
⚠️ This tool is currently alpha quality software and is not ready for production use.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required fields.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

The tool currently only shows the first 20 playlists and searches for the first 100 songs in a playlist.
